# Contacts Directory

_A simple contact directory implementation with the help of Ternary Search Tree_

**Get Started**
1. Get the `ContactsDirectory.jar` file from the folder `ContactsDirectory`
2. Run the application by opening `terminal`
        
        $ java -jar ContactsDirectory.jar
        
3. Three operations that you can perform on the directory enter choice :
    - `1` to Add Contact: Enter the Contact Name to add in directory  
    - `2` to Search Contact: Enter contact name to search
    - `3` to Exit : Close the application
    
4. To run test cases run the above command with `test` option
    
        $ java -jar ContactsDirectory.jar test
        


You can use `get(contacName)` method to get the value associated with the given contact name.
